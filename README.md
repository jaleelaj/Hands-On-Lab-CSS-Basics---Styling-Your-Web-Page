The "Solar System" web page aims to educate visitors about the components of our solar system. It includes a heading, an image of the Solar System, and a descriptive paragraph. Additionally, there is a table listing the planets and their distances from the Sun.

## HTML Structure

The HTML code is structured as follows:

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: The document type declaration.
2. `<html>`: The root element of the HTML document.
3. `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document and links to external resources like CSS stylesheets.
4. `<title>`: Sets the title of the web page displayed in the browser tab.
5. `<style>`: Defines inline CSS styles to customize the appearance of various elements.
6. `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the web page.

## CSS Styling

The CSS code is used to style various elements on the web page. Here's how the CSS styling is applied:

2. `td, p`: Sets the text color to red for table data cells and paragraph elements.

## Preview

You can further customize the styles and content of the web page by modifying the HTML and CSS code.
